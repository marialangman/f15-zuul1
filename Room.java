/**
 * Class Room - a room in an adventure game.
 *
 * This class is part of the "World of Zuul" application. 
 * "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  
 *
 * A "Room" represents one location in the scenery of the game.  It is 
 * connected to other rooms via exits.  For each existing exit, the room 
 * stores a reference to the neighboring room.
 * 
 * A "Room" is responsible for storing what Item objects are initially in the room.  A "Room" should be able
 * to store an ArrayList of Items through the add method.  As Van Helsing removes an item from a "Room," 
 * the ArrayList remove method will remove the object.
